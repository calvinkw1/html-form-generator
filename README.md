# html-form-generator

The Challenge:
I want a tool that will help me easily create an html form using a code generator.

The forms fields can be of type text, multiline text or date (with a date picker)
I should be able to label each field, and I should be able to set whether each of them is required or not.

Constraints: 

The generated form: 
should appear on the same page
should be functional (required field validation)
should show submitted data in a table on that same page.
The generated source should also be on the same page (although it could be hidden from immediate view)
A minimum of styling (aligned fields and columns)

Bonus points if you include any or all of:
Live reload of results & source
More types of fields like password, field matching (ie. password or email confirmation), dropdown
Polished Styling
The resulting source code (html, js) should be easily accessible for a copy & paste.
End to end tests
Unit Tests

Notes: 
You don't have to go over every edge case scenarios you encounter while developing the form generator (although the cleaner the better)
